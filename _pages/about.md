Welcome! I am an NYC-based data scientist seeking a job in data science, analytics, or related positions. I received a PhD in Politics from New York University in 2025 and a BA in Political Science and Biochemistry from Case Western Reserve University (_summa cum laude; Phi Beta Kappa_) in 2020.

My doctoral research focused on the effect of the Internet on political news and communication. Specifically, I examined how the rollout of broadband in the 2000s shaped the audience for local newspapers and measured changes in local newspaper coverage of politics using a variety of natural language processing techniques. My earlier research looked at politicians' use of incivility as a rhetorical tool on social media and the fundraising benefits of doing so. Through this research, I developed a number of practical data science skills: natural language processing (embeddings, transfer learning models, deep learning models), machine learning (PyTorch, Sci-kit Learn), large-scale data cleaning, and modern econometric techniques for analyzing data for causal and observational inference. I am proficient in R, Python, and SQL.

During the 2025-26 academic year, I am a part-time instructor at Columbia University, teaching Introduction to American Politics (Lectures Mon/Wed at 6:10pm EST). At NYU, I TA'ed for a number of classes: Power and Politics in America (4x) and Research Methods for Political Science (1x) in the Politics Department, and Causal Inference (2x) in the Center for Data Science. 

Outside of work, you can find me running or watching Tottenham.
