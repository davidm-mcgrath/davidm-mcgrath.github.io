**The Effect of Broadband Rollout on Local Newspaper Coverage and Style**

**Abstract**: The story of local political media in the 21st century is one of decline. Local news outlets have reduced the amount of quality coverage they produce, due to either increased economic constraints or, more cynically, a changing professional culture around norms of journalism. Using local newspapers during the period of broadband expansion in the US from 2000-2005 as a case study, I explore how news producers respond strategically to a changing marketplace, and how they uphold norms of good journalism when economic incentives suggest they should abandon them. With a sample of 527 newspapers and a random selection of 5 million articles from them, I detect how editors and reporters at local newspapers changed what they cover and the style with which they cover those stories, in response to an increase in print competition through broadband internet, which offered users access to a myriad of national outlets that published online. I find that newspapers cover significantly more local politics once their readers can access these larger outlets online. However, this effect is concentrated among smaller local papers. Newspapers do not change the volume of their soft news (here proxied by crime) coverage or national coverage. On style, crime stories do become more negative following broadband rollout, suggesting an attempt to draw more readers through the old tricks of sensationalism; but the magnitude of this effect is small, and neither local news nor national news coverage became more negative. Overall, this paper presents a story of local newspaper editors and reporters broadly trying to uphold norms of good journalism despite the expanded competition. Instead, the main strategic response was to continue doing good journalism on the topics where they retained a competitive advantage.

**The Effect of Broadband Rollout on Partisan Bias in Local Newspapers**

**Abstract**: The rise of partisan media is one of the most consequential trends of the 21st century in American politics. In this paper, I examine that trend and how it has bled into legacy media outlets, namely local newspapers. Increased competition, historically, has led to increased ideological diversity in news outlets. During the mid-20th century, competition was low, and news across all mediums was governed by a strict set of professional norms concerning nonpartisan and objective coverage. Cable news and the internet changed this equilibrium by drastically increasing the level of competition and introducing some more ideological outlets. I investigate the role of broadband internet, specifically. By giving newspaper readers access to better-resourced, print coverage of national news, local newspapers faced competition from a direct substitute for consumers. Theoretically, this would incentivize local newspaper editors to eschew norms of non-partisanship and differentiate themselves from their competitors ideologically to retain readers. Using article-level text data from 502 local newspapers between 2000 and 2005, I test whether the introduction of print competition via broadband led to increased ideological diversity in the local newspaper coverage of national news. In particular, I expected that they would differentiate in favor of the majority party in their market. Instead, I found that newspapers pivoted towards the center and moved away from the ideology of the readers that they were most likely to lose. While this does not rule out the possibility that legacy media outlets eventually became more partisan, my findings suggest that the norms of objective journalism were robust enough to survive even as their economic supports diminished.

**Selective Incivility: Politiciansâ€™ Use of Uncivil Language on Twitter**

**Abstract**: American politics is in the midst of a so-called crisis of civility that most politicians decry --- and yet willingly exacerbate. Despite this fact, incivility has primarily been studied in terms of its effects, not its causes. Here I offer an explanation for the latter: uncivil behavior, while unpopular broadly, is rewarded with campaign donations from the base. Time-series analyses of campaign donation data and messages posted on Twitter by incumbent members of Congress in the five months before the 2022 midterm elections show that uncivil tweets were followed immediately by substantial spikes in donations for the politicians who authored them. A given politician is more likely to be uncivil when tweeting about polarizing topics or when engaging with members of the opposing party. Incivility is employed more frequently by male politicians and those who are in safe seats, indicating this is a tactic that is employed to raise money when electoral risk is low. It is also more common among  Republicans, especially those first elected after the emergence of Trump suggesting that this rhetorical fundraising tool is becoming more prevalent over time as tolerance for incivility grows.
